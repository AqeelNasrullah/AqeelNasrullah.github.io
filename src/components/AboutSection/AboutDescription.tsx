      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        From a young fascination with websites to my current pursuit of
        cutting-edge technologies, my passion for MERN Stack development has
        been unwavering. With over 2+ years of experience, I've completed
        several notable projects, including Retirement Edge, an accounts system
        for FPS Group, and StopTheFake, an authentication platform for online
        purchases in France. Additionally, I've worked on WazzCards, a
        comprehensive school management system, and Slamitt, empowering Indian
        brands with a digital competition management platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficient in React, Next.js, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL,
        PostgreSQL, and React Native, I prioritize user experience and welcome
        collaborative suggestions. Let's shape the future of software
        development together!
